Namaste. 
I am a.... How can i say it?
!developer. 
6/04/2020 was where my humble origins lie, on whastapp. "You wanna try too" from my friend, who I learn programming alongside.
As of yet I am proficent in:
  Java.
  python.
  C#
  API's and js.
  unity.
  and this list ain't stopping
I honestly never thought I would make it here, and this isn't even my final form. So join me on my quest to become a hobbyist, big time game developer, and hopefully a programming youtuber!
I want to thank my brother @SpicyChair (Ethan) for even allowing me to learn Java alongside him. Programming was not an area I was looking at, i was bad at Python as it was. 
And now, I just commited the latest version of my dsicord bot to Heroku for server hosting on the frontend, as a gift to my friends!
And my PC, for standing true to the test of time. 
Support the grind would ya :)?
